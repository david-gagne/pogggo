# Pogggo - The modern music sharing application

### Backstory
For months now I've wanted to build an application that would allow me to quickly and easily share music with friends. My original idea was a website that would enable anyone to share their favorite tunes with a single link. 

I believed that receiving a single URL to a curated library of someone's favorite music would save everyone loads of time:

- Friends who share music can better organize their favorite music for sending.
- And those looking for new music suggestions can more easily discover great tunes.

Pogggo is a solution to the problem of sharing music in the age of robust streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music, and Tidal. Simply send your friends a link to your Pogggo library and they'll be able to see all your favorite tunes organized and ready for your auditory pleasure.

## Getting Started

If you're new to Git, I recommend that you go read this short guide:

http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/

or watch this video here:

Once you're ready, go ahead and fork this repository like so:
 
![Forking the Pogggo repo on GitHub](https://media.giphy.com/media/QKlIQKzzPoH3Xbe5C2/giphy.gif)

This will create a completely separate copy of the entire Pogggo source code on your GitHub account. This is done so that you can make changes in a sandbox totally isolated from the original code. 

Now go ahead and clone your forked Pogggo code, by opening your terminal and running:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pogggo.git
```

__Note__: Be sure to replace the _your-username_ with your actual GitHub account username.

You can find the link to your forked Pogggo repository at the repo page on your account.

### Prerequisites

In order for you to be able to run Pogggo on your machine, you'll need the following items:

- Node & The Node Package Manager (NPM)

You can install Node and NPM via the official website here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Or, you can use the Node Version Manager (NVM). You can find out how to do so here: [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script) 

Windows users: To install NVM on a Windows machine, you'll need to go here: [NVM for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)

Once you've got Node and Npm installed; in your terminal, navigate to your Pogggo directory and run:

```
node app.js
```

I've set the server to run on port 3000. So open your favorite browser and go to ``` localhost:3000 ``` 

If everything was done correctly, you should see something like this:

And that's it! You can now contribute to the Pogggo build!

Many thanks,
